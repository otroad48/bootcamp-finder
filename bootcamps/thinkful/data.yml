  Thinkful has two different web development programs. The Full Stack Flex program is unique among bootcamps in that it achieves
  the same end goals while remaining compatible with students'' normal job schedules.
  In the full-time Engineering Immersion program, Thinkful students spend all day learning
  for 17 weeks straight. At this level of immersion, students require constant support,
  and are surrounded by a team of instructors, TA''s, 1-on-1 mentors, as well as their
  classmates.

  at top companies in their area. Currently, students in [Atlanta](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/atlanta/),

    description: !!python/unicode 'Thinkful''s data science bootcamp is driven by
      1-on-1 mentorship. Students learn the skills they need to get a job by working
      closely with a professional data scientist. That includes programming in Python,
      related Python packages for analysis, modeling, and machine learning like NumPy,
      SciPy, pandas, and scikit-learn; plus data visualization tools like matplotlib,
      seaborn, and Jupyter. Thinkful students get ahead with a mentor-personalized
      experience, customizing their learning path and focusing on the skills they
      need. Students meet with their mentor three times a week for an hour each session
      to learn best practices, receive constant feedback, and move quickly.
